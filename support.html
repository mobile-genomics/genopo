                                    which permits straightforward integration of new C/C++ analysis tools into F5N.

                                <p>
                                    In our case, the fact that all the necessary tools (Minimap2, Samtools and F5C) were
                                    written
                                    in C/C++ let us
                                    to follow the same approach to compile them for Android. The approach can be
                                    summarized
                                    as
                                    shown in Fig. S1.
                                    3
                                    Before starting the compilation we tested the tools using Termux (a terminal
                                    emulator
                                    with
                                    Linux environment for
                                    Android)<a href="#ref10">[10]</a>. In Termux, the tools’ git repositories were
                                    cloned
                                    and
                                    built as instructed on
                                    the respective installation
                                    guides. This method can be known as native compiling. If a tool gets natively
                                    compiled
                                    in
                                    Termux, we can reasonably
                                    expect the tool to get cross-compiled for Android. There are two major Instruction
                                    Set
                                    Architectures (ISA) for
                                    ARM mobile devices called armeabi-v7a and arm64-v8a. Termux was installed on
                                    multiple
                                    devices with different
                                    architectures to make sure that the tools can be natively compiled in both the
                                    architectures. It is noteworthy that in
                                    Termux, the executable versions (.exe format) of the tools were built in contrast to
                                    their
                                    dynamic library versions (.so
                                    format). To build an Android application, the dynamic version of an original tool is
                                    required<a href="#ref11">[11]</a>. All the Android
                                    applications are a subset of Java programs and the gateway to the native (C/C++)
                                    code is
                                    obtained by loading the
                                    dynamic version of the native tool. To obtain a dynamic version of the tool (.so
                                    format), we
                                    can change the build
                                    configuration and natively compile in Termux. However, this method is not encouraged
                                    as
                                    it
                                    can impose device based
                                    restrictions on .so files which can result in intensive and costly debugging. The
                                    recommended method to obtain the
                                    dynamic version of a tool is to cross-compile using the Android Tool-chain<a
                                        href="#ref12">[12]</a>. This
                                    eliminates the burden associated
                                    with native compiling and simplifies the process of updating the tools to their
                                    latest
                                    versions. This in return automates

                                <h4 id="partIIC">Determining third party libraries used by an analysis tool</h4>
                                <p>
                                    It is necessary to determine the third party libraries used by the analysis tools
                                    (Minimap2,
                                    Samtools and F5C).
                                    A tool to function correctly, associated third party libraries should also be linked
                                    statically or dynamically with the
                                    tool, i.e., third party libraries should also be cross-compiled. Samtools depends on
                                    htslib
                                    <a href="#ref13">[13]</a> library. F5C depends
                                    on both htslib and HDF5 <a href="#ref14">[14]</a> libraries. Hdf5 library is used to
                                    handle
                                    fast5 files and there
                                    exists no straightforward
                                    method to cross compile hdf5. Hence we used native compiled instances of HDF5
                                    library
                                    (the
                                    instances that were
                                    built using Termux). We maintained two instances of HDF5, one for each Architecture
                                    (armeabi-v7a and arm64-v8a).
                                    These third party libraries were statically linked to respective shared libraries.
                                    If a
                                    third party library is being used
                                    by two dependent tools, make sure to link a dynamic version of the library. For an
                                    example
                                    in our case, htslib was
                                    used by Samtools and F5C. Trying to statically link htslib separately to each tool,
                                    caused
                                    the software to crash on
                                    some devices. This was resolved by linking htslib dynamically.

                                <p>
                                    JNI acts as the bridge between native (C/C++) methods and Java function calls. In
                                    JNI
                                    interface, each tool’s int
                                    main(int argc, char* argv[]) function was called. The function name, int main(int
                                    argc,
                                    char* argv[]) was renamed
                                    as int init X(int argc, char* argv[]) where X was Minimap2,Samtools or F5C. This
                                    function
                                    renaming is necessary
                                    as the tools are not stand-alone executable applications but dynamic libraries.
                                    Moreover, a
                                    header file was introduced
                                    for each tool that contained the function signature
                                    <code>int init X(int argc, char* argv[])</code>.
                                    JNI
                                    interface was extended to
                                    facilitate the following,
                                    <ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
                                        <li>Handle exit signals returned by native code</li>

                                        <li>A tunnel between the native code and the Java program to communicate

                                    It is important to handle different types of signals and errors thrown by the native
                                    code to
                                    prevent JVM from
                                    crashing. For example the original code most probably will exit with an error if
                                    something
                                    goes wrong. This kills
                                    the JVM if not handled. We want to keep the JVM running throughout a F5N session. In
                                    order
                                    to do that, the exit
                                    call should be caught and handled in JNI <a href="#ref15">[15]</a>. In a similar
                                    manner,
                                    SIGSEGV signals should
                                    be handled safely
                                    <a href="#ref16">[16]</a>. Once an exit call or SIGSEGV signal is handled this
                                    should be
                                    informed to Java program
                                    so that the user can
                                    investigate the problem. To do this, exceptions are thrown from JNI to Java <a
                                        href="#ref17">[17]</a>.
                                    The original C/C++ tools take input as command line arguments. When a pipeline with
                                    more
                                    than one step is
                                    executed, the native code attempts to read the same argument vector multiple times.
                                    If
                                    the
                                    argument vector is not reset
                                    after the completion of the first step, arguments do not get parsed in the second
                                    step
                                    as
                                    desired. This resetting part

                                    is not implemented in most of the original libraries. In JNI this should be
                                    implemented
                                    to
                                    avoid failures associated

                                        IV - Using a file pipe to listen standard error.</figcaption>

                                    Typically a tool writes the results to the standard ouput and meta-information to
                                    the
                                    standard error. On Android,
                                    we want the results to be written to a file and meta-information to be displayed on
                                    a
                                    GUI in
                                    real-time. To write
                                    results to a file, most of the tools provide a command line argument called file
                                    output
                                    path. Otherwise, in terminal
                                    environments like in Linux, we can redirect the standard output to a file (using the
                                    output
                                    redirection operator ‘>’).
                                    On Android, this is not possible. To overcome this issue two methods can be adopted.
                                    The
                                    first is to open up a
                                    file pipe in JNI to listen to the standard ouput, where the results will get written
                                    to
                                    this
                                    file <a href="#figure2">(Fig. S2 Method I)</a>.
                                    The second is to define the output file path as an argument in the original code <a
                                        href="#figure2">(Fig. S2 Method II)</a>. However, all
                                    the libraries in F5N had output file path as an argument. Now we present two methods
                                    to
                                    catch the standard error,
                                    which should be displayed to the user in real-time. The first method is to replace
                                    all
                                    the
                                    fprintf(stderr,...) functions
                                    with functions defined in NDK logging <a href="#ref19">[19]</a>. Then the standard
                                    error
                                    will get written to
                                    Android Logcat <a href="#ref20">[20]</a>. From
                                    Android Logcat, it is again piped to be displayed <a href="#figure2">(Fig. S2 Method
                                        III)</a>. In practice, this
                                    method does not guarantee
                                    to display the complete set of messages written to the standard error during an
                                    execution.
                                    The more robust method
                                    is to open a file descriptor to listen to the standard error. Then this file should
                                    be
                                    read
                                    in Java side and the GUI
                                    should be updated <a href="#figure2">(Fig. S2 Method IV)</a>. This involves no
                                    amendments in
                                    the original libraries
                                    but a declaration of
                                    file descriptors in JNI code.

                                    To facilitate the modifications discussed above, the original repositories of the
                                    tools
                                    were
                                    forked and changed.
                                    Different tools use different build configurations. The build scripts for each tool
                                    were
                                    re-written using CMake.
                                    Suppose an original tool is built with GNU Make using a Makefile. In that case, one
                                    has
                                    to
                                    extract the source files,
                                    header files, compiler flags, linked libraries etc to create a CMakeLists.txt file.
                                    Refer
                                    how a CMakeLists.txt was written
                                    for htslib <a href="#ref20">[21]</a>. CMake along with Ninja is the recommended
                                    native

                                    setup for Android.
                                    Compiling with CMake
                                    allows ADB to go deep into the native code when debugging. This was really helpful
                                    to

                                    version issue related to htslib library. It was straightforward to link the
                                    necessary
                                    third

                                    htslib) and system libraries (libz, liblog, libm etc) with original libraries using
                                    CMake.

                                    eliminates the

                                    The part of F5N written in Java is dynamic and adaptive. For example the arguments

                                    JSON format and objects are created by converting JSON objects to Java objects. In

                                    F5N and arguments
                                    are decoupled making it easy to alter the format of the arguments if needed. The

                                    linked with arguments are
                                    drawn programmatically instead of manually drawing them on the layout. This makes it

                                <p>
                                    F5N is not built as an Android background process. That is because when processing a
                                    dataset,
                                    F5N may consume
                                    memory more than the recommended amount for a background process. Android kills such
                                    over memory
                                    consuming
                                    background processes. Hence, F5N is built as a regular Android application. However,
                                    this
                                    introduced a caveat.
                                    That is when running a pipeline, the device display should be kept on. That is
                                    because
                                    Android
                                    interrupts running
                                    applications once the display goes off. Hence, F5N has to keep the display on and
                                    this
                                    increases
                                    power consumption.
                                    Our workaround is to reduce the display brightness to its minimal value, once a
                                    pipeline
                                    execution starts. With this
                                    method, device B’s battery (3060 mAh) drains approximately by 214.2 mAh for a
                                    complete
                                    methylation calling
                                    pipeline on a batch data-set (∼34.49 Mbases on average).

                                <p>
                                    Android tends to kill a process or destroy an activity if something goes wrong. In
                                    F5N
                                    usually
                                    it is the case when
                                    the native code tries to over consume memory. Since this kill signal comes from the
                                    Android
                                    Kernel, it cannot be
                                    handled. The simple solution is to be aware of the device memory and set memory
                                    governing
                                    parameters accordingly

                                    executed command and
                                    loading it later, saves time time taken to configure the pipeline again. In the next
                                    attempt,
                                    the user is advised to
                                    tweak memory parameters as it is the solution most of the time.

                                    Already executing native code on Android cannot be stopped arbitrarily. The
                                    ramification
                                    of this
                                    is that the user
                                    cannot suspend or stop an executing pipeline. On the other hand, JVM being a
                                    multi-threaded
                                    process and JNI calls
                                    not being POSIX async-signal-safe, it is not possible to run the native code in a
                                    cloned
                                    process. As a consequence
                                    peak RAM usage will record the highest RAM usage for the whole application session
                                    rather than
                                    for the latest
                                    pipeline execution. To circumvent both problems the ”safest” solution is to restart
                                    F5N.
                                    An
                                    advanced method to
                                    suspend or stop an executing command is by adding interrupt listeners to the
                                    original
                                    code. That
                                    is while the original

                                <p>
                                    A mobile phone has two storage types - internal storage and external storage (SD
                                    card
                                    storage).
                                    FAT32 is a popular
                                    file system format used in SD cards. However, FAT32 does not support files with more
                                    than the
                                    size of ∼4GB. Usually,
                                    the partitioned genome reference file exceeds the size 4GB. Therefore, the user is
                                    advised to
                                    use file system formats
                                    like ext3, ext4, exFAT32 etc as the SD card file system format. Out of these
                                    formats,
                                    exFAT32 is
                                    recommended. It is
                                    noteworthy that Google has introduced (from Android 8.0) a virtual file system
                                    wrapper
                                    called
                                    SDCardFS to regulate
                                    SD card access by Android applications. However, still, the SD card should have one
                                    of
                                    the
                                    compatible file system
                                    formats to work with larger files.
                                    Downloading and extracting a dataset to the SD card can be done after setting SD
                                    card
                                    permission. On Android,
                                    writing to the SD card storage via native code (C/C++) can only be done using
                                    Storage
                                    Access
                                    Framework (SAF)<a href="#ref27">[27]</a>.
                                    To implement SAF, most of the original code has to be changed. One workaround is to
                                    use
                                    the
                                    Method I as illustrated
                                    in <a href="#figure2">Fig. S2</a>. In JNI interface, we can use SAF to write the
                                    standard output
                                    to the SD card.
                                    However, there are sub-tools
                                    that directly write to files, e.g., F5C index writes files automatically to the
                                    dataset
                                    directory. In such scenarios, the
                                    original tool should be reconfigured to facilitate SAF. The current version of F5N
                                    does
                                    not
                                    support this feature.
                                    Therefore the user cannot perform writes to the SD card but can read from it.

                                <h4 id="partIVE">Including a new analysis tool</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The <a href="#partIII">Supplementary Section III</a> explains the procedure to
                                    include a
                                    new
                                    analysis tool in F5N.
                                    However if the new
                                    tool creates a comparatively large .so file, instead of directly linking it with the
                                    existing
                                    .so files (step 14), it can be
                                    kept as a separate .so file which can be loaded to JVM as required. Nanopolish’s .so
                                    file is ∼50
                                    MB while the sum
                                    of the other .so files is ∼17 MB. Hence, we separated out Nanopolish’s .so file and
                                    it
                                    is loaded
                                    to F5N only if the
                                    user set the pipeline type to “Mode 2” inside F5N settings (add screenshot). Every
                                    time
                                    the user
                                    switches between
                                    pipeline types - “Mode 1” and “Mode 2”, F5N needs to be restarted for the changes to
                                    take
                                    effect. This is because
                                    the JVM has to unload the existing library and load a new one. Please note that, in
                                    both
                                    pipeline types Minimap2
                                    and Samtools commands can be executed but F5C is only supported in “Mode 1 and
                                    Nanopolish is
                                    only supported
                                    in “Mode 2”
